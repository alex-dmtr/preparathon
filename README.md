# roadmap

To install:
`npm install`

To run database sync and tests:
`npm test`

To run app (you must run sync before):
`npm start`

You'll need a postgres server to attach to. The app is configured to connect to the database `roadmap`; if it doesn't exist you need to create it before running tests or running the app.
