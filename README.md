# roadmap

## To install:
`npm install`

Then create an `.env` file in the root directory and add there the environment variables requested in `app.js`.

You'll need a postgres server to attach to. The app is configured to connect to the database `roadmap`; if it doesn't exist you need to create it before running tests or running the app.


## To run database sync and tests:
`npm test`

## To run app (you must run sync before):
`npm start`
